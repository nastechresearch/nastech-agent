"""A host that mirrors the served profile into NASTECH_HOME must not flip launch-home identity.

Nastech WebUI serves several profiles from one process and, for legacy readers, mirrors the active
turn's profile into ``os.environ["NASTECH_HOME"]`` while also installing the context-local override.
Every "is this task routed / is this the launch home" decision that compared the override with the
live env var then saw the served home as the launch home: MCP connections were keyed by bare name
(shared across profiles), the launch residue was never stripped from the served profile's child env,
the launch profile's bridged allow-all grant was seeded into the served profile's secret scope, and
the served profile's ``terminal.*`` config was bridged into the shared process env.
``nastech_constants.pin_process_nastech_home`` gives such hosts one stable anchor for all of them.
