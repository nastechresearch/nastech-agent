"""Ink's gateway bootstrap: a thin wrapper over ``nastech_cli.gateway_runtime_attach.attach_gateway``,
the attach ``nastech gateway attach`` runs. The child is a client, never an agent owner.

``--start`` ensures the owner (first launch). A reconnect discovers only, except ``--recover``
(a bounded slot, ``@nastech/shared/gateway-client`` ``OWNER_RECOVERY_LIMIT`` per window) re-ensures whenever the
owner is not ready: it crashed, ended by its idle exit, was stopped with ``nastech gateway stop``
while this TUI was open, or an older Nastech's gateway answers (ensure replaces that one). Main's TUI
ran its own sidecar and never depended on an external daemon, so an open TUI comes back on its own.
